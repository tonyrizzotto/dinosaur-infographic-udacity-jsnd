# Intermediate Javascript Nano Degree

## Project #1 Dinosaur Infographic

### Overview

The Dinosaur Infographic is the first project in satisfacion of the Intermedite Javascript Nanodegree with Udacity. This single page application, or SPA, utilizes object-oriented javascript to collect user data and run a list of comparisions based on height, weight and diet. The application then re-writes, or appends, the window to display a set of randomly generated facts based on the users input. The user can then click to reset the form and enter new information to get different results.

The main motivation of this project was to improve my understading with:

- Object-oriented programming
- Gain a deeper understanding of vanilla javascript
